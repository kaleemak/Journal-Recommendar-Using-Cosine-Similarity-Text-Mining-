ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS,"The Journal of Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems invites submissions of original technical papers describing research and development in emerging technologies in computing systems. Major economic and technical challenges are expected to impede the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. This has resulted in the search for alternate mechanical, biological/biochemical, nanoscale electronic, asynchronous and quantum computing and sensor technologies. As the underlying nanotechnologies continue to evolve in the labs of chemists, physicists, and biologists, it has become imperative for computer scientists and engineers to translate the potential of the basic building blocks (analogous to the transistor) emerging from these labs into information systems. Their design will face multiple challenges ranging from the inherent (un)reliability due to the self-assembly nature of the fabrication processes for nanotechnologies, from the complexity due to the sheer volume of nanodevices that will have to be integrated for complex functionality, and from the need to integrate these new nanotechnologies with silicon devices in the same system.

The journal provides comprehensive coverage of innovative work in the specification, design analysis, simulation, verification, testing, and evaluation of computing systems constructed out of emerging technologies and advanced semiconductors. Topics include, but are not limited to:

Logic Primitive Design and Synthesis
how to design computational logic primitives from the new nanotechnologies and design tools supporting their effective design and verification
System-Level Specification, Design and Synthesis
how to interconnect these computational primitives to build complete information systems, and design tools for specifying, synthesizing, and verifying such systems
Software-Level Specification, Design and Synthesis
how to develop the necessary software so that applications can be effectively mapped onto information systems implemented using these new nanotechnologies, and tools for generating and verifying the software
Mixed-Technology Systems

APPLIED ONTOLOGY,"In recent years, the dramatic growth of information and communication technologies has led to an increasingly interdisciplinary approach to research and development activities in these fields. To exploit the immense opportunities of widespread networks effectively, designers of modern information systems need to combine the precision of formal semantics with the needs of cognitive transparency, as they incorporate increasingly sophisticated and heterogeneous information content. The recent explosion of interest on ontologies is an important component of this trend. Researchers in disciplines such as knowledge engineering, information systems modeling, artificial intelligence, formal and computational linguistics, information retrieval, library science, and knowledge management have come to realize that a solid foundation for their research calls for serious work in ontology, understood as a general theory of the types of entities and relations that make up their respective domains of inquiry. In all these areas, attention has started to focus squarely on the content of information, rather than on just the formats and languages used to represent that content. 

Applied Ontology focuses on information content in its broadest sense. As the subtitle makes clear, two broad kinds of content-based research activities are envisioned: ontological analysis and conceptual modeling. The former includes any attempt to investigate the nature and structure of a domain of interest using rigorous philosophical or logical tools; the latter concerns the cognitive and linguistic structures we use to model the world, as well as the various analysis tools and methodologies we adopt for producing useful computational models, such as information systems schemes or knowledge structures. Applied Ontology is the first journal with explicit and exclusive focus on ontological analysis and conceptual modeling under an interdisciplinary view. It aims to establish a unique niche in the realm of scientific journals by carefully avoiding unnecessary duplication with discipline-oriented journals. For this reason, authors will be encouraged to use language that will be intelligible also to those outside their specific sector of expertise, and the review process will be tailored to this end. For example, authors of theoretical contributions will be encouraged to show the relevance of their theory for applications, while authors of more technological papers will be encouraged to show the relevance of a well-founded theoretical perspective. Moreover, the journal will publish papers focusing on representation languages or algorithms only where these address relevant content issues, whether at the level of practical application or of theoretical understanding. Similarly, it will publish descriptions of tools or implemented systems only where a contribution to the practice of ontological analysis and conceptual modeling is clearly established. 

Applied Ontology aims at being a major publication forum for theoretical and applied research in a variety of topics, tentatively grouped together in research areas, examples of which are indicated in the list below.

Foundational issues ? Philosophical foundations of ontology ? Basic ontological categories and relations ? Ontology, epistemology, and semiotics
Specialized ontologies ? Ontology of time, events and processes ? Ontology of space and geography ? Ontology of physics and physical objects ? Ontology of biomedicine ? Ontology of mental entities ? Ontology of agents and actions ? Ontology of organizations and social reality ? Ontology of the information society ? Ontology of business and e-commerce ? Ontology of law ? Ontology of history, culture and evolution
Ontology development and ontology-driven conceptual modeling ? Methodologies for ontology development ? Impact of ontological analysis on current modeling practices ? Best-practice examples and case studies
Ontology management ? Tools for ontology development, analysis and comparison ? Comparison and evaluation of ontologies ? Ontology management, maintenance, versioning ? Methodologies for ontology merging, alignment, and integration ? Semantic Web
Ontology and language ? Ontology and natural-language semantics ? Ontology and lexical resources ? Ontology and terminology ? Ontology learning techniques and their evaluation ? Role of ontology in natural-language systems
Ontology, cognition, perception ? Conceptual schemas, perceptual invariances and ontological categorization ? Psychological experiments evaluating the cognitive adequacy of ontological categories
Ontology and content standards ? Library science ? Knowledge organization ? Museums and cultural repositories ? Multimedia content ? Product descriptions ? Process and service descriptions ? Biomedical and other scientific terminologies

This research aims to increase the speed and capacity of digital communication and strengthen security by improving the encryption necessary to combat cryptanalytic attacks. With improved encryption, communication will become more secure from the cryptanalytic attacks that threaten the confidentiality and integrity of personal data stored on and transmitted by mobile devices. Increasing the speed, reliability, and capacity of wireless communication is essential for growth, since the radio spectrum is a bounded resource.

While sometimes treated as separate entities with distinct research goals, communication and cryptography often use similar models and techniques and work in tandem in digital networks. As a result, this journal?s distinctive combination encourages researchers to strive for advancements that will improve both areas simultaneously, thus providing a publishing forum for these domains, covering all the fundamental and computational aspects of these research fields.

The journal publishes high-quality papers dealing with cryptography, error-correcting codes, communications and their interactions. Both theoretical and applied papers will be considered, with an emphasis on supporting applications. Applications include channel coding, wireless communications (e.g., mobile phones and satellite communications), security of the Internet, banking transfer security, and embedded security devices.

The scope of the journal focuses on discrete structures used in stream and block ciphers in symmetric cryptography; code division multiple access in communications; and random number generation for statistics, cryptography and numerical methods.

DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY,"Designs, Codes and Cryptography is an archival peer-reviewed technical journal publishing survey and original papers in the designated areas. There is a great deal of activity in design theory, coding theory and cryptography and recently there has been considerable research done which brings together more than one of the subjects. Journals currently exist for each of the individual areas but none encourage the interaction of the disciplines.

Some of these journals emphasize only the theoretical aspects of each subject, some only the practical. The aim of this journal is to provide a forum for high quality papers of both a theoretical and a practical nature which bridge more than one of these areas. The scope of the journal is wider. Papers emphasizing the algebraic and geometric aspects of any of the areas will be considered with papers touching more than one of the areas being especially welcome.

The journal will be published twelve times per year with distribution to engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and other in education, industry and government. It will maintain strict refereeing procedures and no paper previously published in another journal, transactions or book will be considered. Survey papers will be by invitation only."
DISPLAYS,"Displays is the international journal covering the research, development and application of displays technology and its effective presentation of visual information.

Since the mid-1990s, web-based information management has used distributed and/or parallel data management to replace their centralized cousins. The maturation of the field, together with the new issues that are raised by the changes in the underlying technology, requires a central focus for work in the area. Distributed and Parallel Databases provides such a focus for the presentation and dissemination of new research results, systems development efforts, and user experiences in distributed and parallel database systems.BioMed Research International is a peer-reviewed, Open Access journal that publishes original research articles, review articles, and clinical studies covering a wide range of subjects in life sciences and medicine.

The journal also features special issues on these topics; again covering the full range from the design to the use of our targeted systems."
EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,"Empirical Software Engineering provides a forum for applied software engineering research with a strong empirical component.

Over the last decade, it has become clear that empirical studies are a fundamental component of software engineering research and practice: Software development practices and technologies must be investigated by empirical means in order to be understood, evaluated, and deployed in proper contexts. This stems from the observation that higher software quality and productivity is more likely to be achieved if well-understood, tested practices and technologies are introduced in software development.

Reported empirical studies usually involve the collection and analysis of data and experience that can be used to characterize, evaluate and reveal relationships between software development deliverables, practices, and technologies. Over time, it is expected that such empirical results will form a body of knowledge leading to widely accepted and well-formed theories.

Empirical Software Engineering aims at promoting the publication of industry-relevant research since one of its goals is to address the significant gap between research and practice.

Research Articles

Both original and replicated studies can be reported, varying from controlled experiments to field studies, from data intensive to qualitative. Preference is given to studies that can be replicated or expanded upon. Papers on the infrastructure for supporting empirical research are also of interest.

FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING,"This journal aims to publish contributions at the junction of theory and practice.  The objective is to disseminate applicable research.  Thus new theoretical contributions are welcome where they are motivated by potential application; applications of existing formalisms are of interest if they show something novel about the approach or application.

The term ""formal methods"" has been applied to a range of notations, theories and tools.  There is no doubt that some of these have already had a significant impact on practical applications of computing.  Indeed, it is interesting to note that once something is adopted into practical use it is no longer thought of as a formal method.  Apart from widely used notations such as those for syntax and state machines, there have been significant applications of specification notations, development methods and tools both for proving general results and for searching for specific conditions.  However, the most profound and lasting influence of the formal approach is the way it has illuminated fundamental concepts like those of communication.

In this spirit, the principal aim of this journal is to promote the growth of computing science, to show its relation to practice and to stimulate applications of apposite formalisms to practical problems.  One significant challenge is to show how a range of formal models can be related to each other. 

In particular, the scope of Formal Aspects of Computing includes, 
well-founded notations for the description of systems
verifiable design methods
elucidation of fundamental computational concepts
approaches to fault-tolerant design
theorem-proving support
state-exploration tools
formal underpinning of widely used notations and methods
formal approaches to requirements analysis

Normal scientific standards are expected of all contributors: papers must be soundly based, place their contribution in context and provide adequate references.  Material which is already widely available (e.g. as conference proceedings) will not normally be considered unless the work has been further developed and refined"

Methods for artificial evolution of active components, such as programs or machines, are rapidly developing branches of adaptive computation and adaptive engineering. They entail the development, evaluation and application of methods that mirror the process of neo-Darwinian evolution and produce as a result computational expressions such as algorithms or machines such as mechanical or electronic devices that actively process environmental information and transform their environment. In addition to its main topics, the journal covers related topics such as evolutionary algorithms with variable-size genomes, alternate methods of program induction, approaches to engineering systems development based on embryology, morphogenesis or other techniques inspired by adaptive natural systems."
GEOINFORMATICA,"GeoInformatica is located at the confluence of two rapidly advancing domains: Computer Science and Geographic Information Science; nowadays, Earth studies use more and more sophisticated computing theory and tools, and computer processing of Earth observations through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) attracts a great deal of attention from governmental, industrial and research worlds.

This journal aims to promote the most innovative results coming from the research in the field of computer science applied to geographic information systems. Thus, GeoInformatica provides an effective forum for disseminating original and fundamental research and experience in the rapidly advancing area of the use of computer science for spatial studies.

Many topics in the field of computer science involve a very specific approach in the domain of geographic information systems; therefore the topics that are addressed include, but are not limited to:
Spatial Modeling: spatial data models integrating the geometric and semantic aspects of geographic information, requirements analysis for GIS applications, GIS performance modeling and evaluation, qualitative aspects of geographic information, impact of spatial information handling on computing models.
Spatial Databases: spatio-temporal data structures, spatial data storage and indexing techniques, query processing and optimization, spatial database knowledge discovery, GIS metadata, multidatabase GIS.
Human-Computer Interfaces for GIS: graphic user interfaces for GIS, graphic browser interfaces for navigating spatial databases, multimedia applied to GIS, virtual reality for representing spatial data.
Digital Cartography at the Core of GIS: multidimensional digital map display technology, cartographic generalization for multiscale representation, computer-aided cartographic design, automated map aesthetics management, dynamic cartography, animated map technology.
Space Imagery in GIS: remote sensing, spatial image processing, shape recognition from aerial and satellite images, spatial information measurement and retrieval.
Parallelism, Distribution and Communication through GIS: parallel, distributed processing of spatial data, client-server architecture for GIS, GIS and cooperative work, manipulation of geographic information over the Internet, interoperability among heterogeneous GIS, electronic geographic data interchange standards, concurrent and distributed spatial objects.
Spatio-Temporal Reasoning: reasoning in GIS, spatio-temporal knowledge processing, fuzzy spatio-temporal information, artificial intelligence in GIS, genetic and neural algorithms in GIS, moving objects within GIS, real-time GIS, active spatio-temporal objects.

GeoInformatica is focused on Advances in Computer Science for GIS as noted in its title. Usually reviewers expect computer science advances for GIS to be general, e.g., applicable to more than one application domain.

Reviewers have often found the following types of papers outside GeoInformatica's scope: 
(a) application of a previously known computer science concept or application of software to a new GIS problem, and 
(b) computer science advances with a tenuous connection to GIS problems."

IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING,"This magazine provides a journal-quality evaluation and review of Internet-based computer applications and enabling technologies. It also provides a source of information as well as a forum for both users and developers. The focus of the magazine is on Internet services using WWW, agents, and similar technologies. This does not include traditional software concerns such as object-oriented or structured programming, or Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) or Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) standards. The magazine may, however, treat the intersection of these software technologies with the Web or agents. For instance, the linking of ORBs and Web servers or the conversion of KQML messages to object requests are relevant technologies for this magazine. An article strictly about CORBA would not be. This magazine is not focused on intelligent systems. Techniques for encoding knowledge or breakthroughs in neural net technologies are outside its scope, as would be an article on the efficacy of a particular expert system. Internet Computing focuses on technologies and applications that allow practitioners to leverage off services to be found on the Internet. Agents are one technology for doing so, independent of claims about intelligence. In fact, most of the useful agent technology being deployed on the Internet is distinct from the multi-user agent technology developed in the AI world. The latter typically focuses on architectures supporting beliefs, intentions, and other human-like characteristics. Such characteristics are typically not relevant to Internet agents. More important are system engineering issues such as Internet mobility, shared protocols, ontologies, registration, and routing. Network software and hardware per se are not in the scope of this magazine. On the other hand, hardware that permits faster execution of a specific Web technology, such as Java chips, would be covered."
IEEE MICRO,"IEEE Micro addresses users and designers of microprocessors and microprocessor systems, including managers, engineers, consultants, educators, and students involved with computers and peripherals, components and subassemblies, communications, instrumentation and control equipment, and guidance systems.

IEEE MULTIMEDIA,"IEEE MultiMedia contains technical information covering a broad range of issues in multimedia systems and applications. Articles discuss research as well as advanced practice in hardware/software and are expected to span the range from theory to working systems. Especially encouraged are papers discussing experiences with new or advanced systems and subsystems. To avoid unnecessary overlap with existing publications, acceptable papers must have a significant focus on aspects unique to multimedia systems and applications. These aspects are likely to be related to the special needs of multimedia information compared to other electronic data, for example, the size requirements of digital media and the importance of time in the representation of such media. The following list is not exhaustive, but is representative of the topics that are covered: Hardware and software for media compression, coding & processing; Media representations & standards for storage, editing, interchange, transmission & presentation; Hardware platforms supporting multimedia applications; Operating systems suitable for multimedia applications; Storage devices & technologies for multimedia information; Network technologies, protocols, architectures & delivery techniques intended for multimedia; Synchronization issues; Multimedia databases; Formalisms for multimedia information systems & applications; Programming paradigms & languages for multimedia; Multimedia user interfaces; Media creation integration editing & management; Creation & modification of multimedia applications.

IJBIC provides the scientific community and industry with a vehicle whereby ideas using two or more conventional and computational intelligence based techniques can be discussed.

Bio-inspired computation is an umbrella term for different computational approaches that are based on principles or models of biological systems. This class of methods, such as evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimisation, and swarm intelligence, complements traditional techniques in the sense that the former can be applied to large-scale applications where little is known about the underlying problem and where the latter approaches encounter difficulties. Therefore, bio-inspired methods are becoming increasingly important in the face of the complexity of today's demanding applications, and accordingly they have been successfully used in various fields ranging from computer engineering and mechanical engineering to chemical engineering and molecular biology.

IJBIC is especially intended for furthering the overall understanding of new algorithms simulated with various bio-phenomena beyond the current focus, i.e. genetic algorithms, Tabu search, etc. Its objective is improvement in theory and applications of the bio-computation field.

Moreover, we do not have journals covering applications and the implementation of security techniques, topics which are important in industry and the business world.

In this new century, The International Journal of Information Security will provide prompt publication of important technical work in information security, whether theoretical, applicable, or related to implementation.

The intended audience includes any person, whether active in the technology or not, whose interests in communications, commerce, banking, medicine, or other areas of endeavor are affected by information security.

The intended author is a technical specialist with the skill and commitment to presenting recent advances in information security to a broad audience around the world.

The intended review process will be peer review by members of the editorial board, with recourse to outside experts where appropriate.

The scope of the International Journal of Information Security (IJIS) is theory, applications, and implementations of information security. This includes, but is not limited to:

- system security - intrusion detection, secure end systems, secure operating systems, database security, security infrastructures, security evaluation

NATURAL COMPUTING,"Natural Computing is a general term referring to computing going on in nature and computing inspired by nature. When complex phenomena going on in nature are viewed as computational processes, our understanding of these phenomena and of the essence of computation is enhanced. In this way one gains valuable insights into both natural sciences and computer science. Characteristic for man-designed computing inspired by nature is the metaphorical use of concepts, principles and mechanisms underlying natural systems. This type of computing includes evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, molecular computing and quantum computing.  

The aim of the journal is (1) to provide a publication forum for, and to foster links and mutual understanding between researchers from various areas of natural computing, (2) to give researchers in natural sciences and computer science an insight into research trends in natural computing. The research in natural computing is concerned with theory, experiments, and applications, and the journal reports on each of these research lines. Moreover, the journal will cover natural computing in a very broad scope. Thus, e.g., the subarea of evolutionary algorithms will cover also very active research on the boundary of biology and computer science which views the evolution as a computational process, and the subarea of neural networks will also cover computational trends in brain research.

The journal is soliciting papers on all aspects of natural computing. Because of the interdisciplinary character of the journal a special effort will be made to solicit survey, review, and tutorial papers which would make research trends in a given subarea more accessible to the broad audience of the journal."

THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE,"Theoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All papers introducing or studying mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods are welcome, provided that their motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing. 
Papers published in Theoretical Computer Science are grouped in three sections according to their nature. The first section `Algorithms, automata, complexity and games' is devoted to the study of algorithms and their complexity using analytical, combinatorial or probabilistic methods. It includes the whole field of abstract complexity (i.e. all the results about the hierarchies that can be defined using Turing machines), the whole field of automata and language theory (including automata on infinite words and infinitary languages), the whole field of geometrical (graphic) applications and the whole field of measurement of system performance using statistical methods. 
The second section,`Logic, semantics and theory of programming', is devoted to formal methods to check properties of programs or implement formally described languages; it contains all papers dealing with semantics of sequential and parallel programming languages. All formal methods treating these problems are published in this section, including rewriting techniques, abstract data types, automatic theorem proving, calculi such as SCP or CCS, Petri nets, new logic calculi and developments in categorical methods.
The third section, 'Natural Computing', is devoted to the study of computing occurring in nature and computing inspired by nature. In the rapidly evolving field of computer science, natural computing plays an important role as the catalyst for the synergy of human designed computing with the computing going on in nature. This synergy leads to a deeper and broader understanding of the nature of computation. Although natural computing is concerned also with experiments and applications, this section of Theoretical Computer Science is focused on the theoretical aspects of natural computing with clear relevance to computing. Among others, it will contain papers dealing with the theoretical issues in evolutionary computing, neural networks, molecular computing, and quantum computing."

VLDB JOURNAL,"Aims
The VLDB Journal is a bi-monthly journal published on behalf of the VLDB Endowment. Launched in July 1992, the journal is now published both in electronic and printed edition by Springer-Verlag.
In addition to its goal as an outlet for high quality and timely research and development results, the journal has two important commitments: to low cost so that it is widely affordable; to a quick publication of accepted papers, so as to publish the most recent and timely results.
High quality and timely publication is achieved by employing a large editorial board of internationally known researchers and a thorough review procedure. Each editor handles a relatively small number of papers at any one time, and can pay more attention to quality and timeliness of reviews. Papers are available electronically to subscribers as soon as they are accepted, regardless of the schedule of the paper version.
The VLDB Endowment Inc.
Scope
The journal is dedicated to the publication of scholarly contributions in areas of data management such as database system technology and information systems, including their architectures and applications.  Further, the journal?s scope is restricted to areas of data management that are covered by the combined expertise of the journal?s editorial board.
Submissions with a substantial theory component are welcome, but the VLDB Journal expects such submissions also to embody a systems component.
In relation to data mining, the journal will handle submissions where systems issues play a significant role. Factors that we use to determine whether a data mining paper is within scope include:
The submission targets systems issues in relation to data mining, e.g., by covering integration with a database engine or with other data management functionality. 
The submission?s contributions build on (rather than simply cite) work already published in database outlets, e.g., VLDBJ, ACM TODS, PVLDB, ACM SIGMOD, IEEE ICDE, EDBT."
